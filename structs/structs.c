/**
 * Structs
 *
 * A struct is a user-definable type that holds multiple pieces of data, potentially of different types.
 * Itâ€™s a convenient way to bundle multiple variables into a single one.
 * This can be beneficial for passing variables to functions (so you just have to pass one instead of many), and useful for organizing data and making code more readable.
